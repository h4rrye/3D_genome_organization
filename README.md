# 3D Genome Organization
<hr>
<h2> SCOPE OF THE PROJECT </h2>
<h4>
The project aims to develop an algorithm for calculating the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of chromosomes. This algorithm generates a surface around the chromosome, representing the interface where genetic material interacts with intracellular molecules such as proteins, Transcription Factors and other DNA-altering compounds. It is designed to be adaptable, allowing for the integration of additional features in the future.

The primary objective of this algorithm is to identify accessible regions of the genome that are exposed to external influences, making them more vulnerable to mutations. These mutations often underlie major diseases like cancer. By studying this phenomenon, the project seeks to provide deeper insights into how 3D genome organization contributes to cancer susceptibility and how gene editing technologies might be leveraged to correct such vulnerabilities.

<h2> FUTURE SCOPE </h2>
<h4>
The future scope of this project includes quantifying the physical properties of the genomic structure and integrating functional data, such as gene expression, histone modifications, and protein binding sites. By mapping these features onto the genomic structure, the project aims to uncover how physical properties influence genomic function and susceptibility. Additionally, this framework can be extended to study changes in the genomic architecture of cancerous cells, identifying underlying structural alterations alongside shifts in expression levels. This comprehensive approach will provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms, contributing to a deeper understanding of how structural and functional dynamics drive genomic vulnerabilities and potential therapeutic strategies.
