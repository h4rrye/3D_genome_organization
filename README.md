# Chromosome SASA Analysis Pipeline
<hr>
<h2> SCOPE OF THE PROJECT </h2>
<h4>
This project develops a cloud-native bioinformatics pipeline for calculating the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of chromosomes. The SASA algorithm generates a surface around the chromosome structure, representing the interface where genetic material interacts with intracellular molecules such as proteins, transcription factors, and other DNA-altering compounds.
The pipeline identifies accessible regions of the genome that are exposed to external influences, making them more vulnerable to mutations—alterations that often underlie major diseases like cancer. By analyzing 3D genome organization, this work provides insights into cancer susceptibility mechanisms and potential gene editing interventions.

**Pipeline Architecture:** The system is built as a production-ready, containerized workflow comprising four modular analysis components:

- SASA calculation and spatial analysis
- Physical properties quantification (curvature, surface geometry)
- Genomic feature mapping and annotation
- Interactive visualization through a web dashboard

The entire pipeline is orchestrated using Nextflow for reproducible workflow management, containerized with Docker for portability, and deployed on AWS infrastructure with a Plotly Dash web interface for accessible data exploration and visualization.</h4>

<h2> FUTURE SCOPE </h2>
<h4>
This framework establishes a foundation for integrating multi-modal genomic data with structural analysis. Future extensions include:
Functional Integration: Mapping gene expression profiles, histone modifications, and protein binding sites onto genomic structures to uncover relationships between physical properties and functional behavior.
Comparative Analysis: Extending the pipeline to analyze architectural differences between normal and cancerous cells, identifying structural alterations that accompany changes in expression levels and cellular function.
Scalability: Leveraging cloud infrastructure to enable high-throughput analysis across multiple cell types, conditions, and patient samples, supporting population-level studies of genomic vulnerability patterns.
Predictive Modeling: Incorporating machine learning approaches to predict mutation susceptibility based on structural features and accessibility patterns, potentially informing therapeutic target identification.
This comprehensive approach bridges structural biology and functional genomics, providing mechanistic insights into how 3D genome organization influences disease susceptibility and therapeutic response.

## Development

This project was developed with assistance from:
- **Code base**: The entire codebase has been manually planned and generated by myself.
- **AI-assisted code debugging**: Claude (Anthropic) and Kiro IDE for debugging, and documentation.
- **Human oversight**: All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and validated
- **Original contributions**: Algorithm design, scientific methodology, and 
  biological interpretation, project design, writing codes, writing and conducting analysis dashboard creation, visualization, and model testing was all done by me.

### Reproducibility Note
The final codebase is fully reproducible without AI tools. All dependencies are 
specified in `requirements.txt` and the code follows standard Python/Nextflow 
conventions.

> FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION will cover a AWS hosted docker image running the entire process via Nextflow pipeline.
